   Permutation polynomials over finite fields are important in many applications, for example in cryptography. We want to provide families of polynomials that are rich in permutation polynomials. In particular we study polynomials of the form $F_{a,b}(x) = x^{\frac{q+1}{2}} + a x^{\frac{q+1}{d}} + b x$, where $a,b \in \mathbb{F}_{q}$, $q=p^r$, $p$ prime and $d \mid (q-1)$.

    The following theorem gives information on the amount of polynomials with the same value set.

    {\Large \begin{theorem}\label{el_teorema}
        Fix $n$, $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \leq q$. The number of polynomials of the form $F_{a,b}(x)$ with $\left\vert V_{F_{a,b}} \right\vert = n$ is a multiple of $d$ if $d$ is even, or a multiple of $2d$ if $d$ is odd.
        \end{theorem}}

    Our main result on permutation polynomials follows as a result of this theorem.

    {\Large \begin{corollary}
          The number of permutation polynomials of the form $F_{a,b}(x)$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ is a multiple of $d$ if $d$ is even, or a multiple of $2d$ if $d$ is odd.
        \end{corollary}}

    Given parameters [$a,b$] that make $F_{a,b}(x)$ a permutation polynomial, we can construct the rest of the parameters that give permutation polynomials of this form as follows:

    \vspace{1em}
    
    {\Large \textbf{Construction}: If  $F_{a,b}(x) = x^{\frac{q+1}{2}} + a x^{\frac{q+1}{d}} + b x$ is a permutation polynomial for $a=\alpha^i$, $b=\alpha^j$ then $F_{a',b'}(x) = x^{\frac{q+1}{2}} + a' x^{\frac{q+1}{d}} + b' x$ is also a permutation polynomial for [$a',b'$] $\in \left\{ \alpha^{i+k (d+2) \frac{q-1}{2d}}, \alpha^{j+k \frac{q-1}{2}} \mid k=1,...,2d-1 \right\}$}

    \vspace{1em}

    \begin{example}
      Fix $d = 3$ and $q = 37$. Let $F_{a,b}(x) = x^{19} + a x^{\frac{38}{3}} + b x$ be a polynomial over $\mathbb{F}_{37}$. We know that the parameters [$4=\alpha^2,31=\alpha^9$] make $F$ a permutation polynomial. Using these parameters we know $F$ is a permutation for the following pairs [$a',b'$]:

      \begin{align*}
        &[7=\alpha^{2+5\cdot 6},6=\alpha^{9+18}], &[3=\alpha^{2+2(5\cdot 6)},31=\alpha^{9+2(18)}], \\
        &[33=\alpha^{2+3(5\cdot 6)},6=\alpha^{9+3(18)}], &[30=\alpha^{2+4(5\cdot 6)},31=\alpha^{9+4(18)}], \\ 
        &[34=\alpha^{2+5(5\cdot 6)},6=\alpha^{9+5(18)}]
      \end{align*}

      Permutations of finite fields have many applications in Coding Theory and Cryptography. One such example is RSA-type cryptosystems. In some of these systems secret messages are encoded as elements of a field $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ with a sufficiently large $q$. The encryption operator used for these systems is defined as a permutation of the field $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ with the decryption operator defined as the inverse of this permutation. Both of these operators need to be efficiently computable, thus it is easy to see that expressing these operators in terms of permutation polynomials is simple and efficient.

\begin{definition*}
  A \textbf{permutation} of a set $A$ is an ordering of the elements of $A$. A function $f: A \rightarrow A$ gives a permutation of $A$ if and only if $f$ is one to one and onto.
\end{definition*}

\vspace{0.3em}

\begin{definition*}
  A \textbf{finite field} $\mathbb{F}_{q}$, $q=p^r$, $p$ prime is a field with $q=p^r$ elements.
\end{definition*}

\vspace{0.3em}

\begin{definition*}
  A \textbf{primitive root} $\alpha \in \mathbb{F}_q$ is a generator for the multiplicative group $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{\times}$
\end{definition*}

\begin{example}
  Consider the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{7}$. We have that: $3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 2, 3^3 = 6, 3^4 = 4, 3^5 = 5, 3^6 = 1$, so $3$ is a primitive root of $\mathbb{F}_{7}$.
\end{example}

\vspace{0.3em}

\begin{definition*}
  Let $f(x)$ be a polynomial defined over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. Then the \textbf{value set} of $f$ is defined as $V_{f} = \left\{f(a) \mid a \in \mathbb{F}_{q} \right\}$
\end{definition*}

\vspace{0.3em}

\begin{definition*}
  Consider a finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. A polynomial $f(x)$ defined over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ is said to be a permutation polynomial if $V_{f} = \mathbb{F}_{q}$.
\end{definition*}

\begin{example}
  Consider the polynomial $f(x) = x+3$ defined over $\mathbb{F}_{7}$. We have that $f(0) = 3, f(1) = 4, f(2) = 5, f(3) = 6, f(4) = 0, f(5) = 1, f(6) = 2$, so $f(x)$ is a permutation polynomial over $\mathbb{F}_{7}$

To characterize which polynomials $F_{a,b}(x)$ are permutation polynomials, we are studying the value sets of $F_{a,b}(x)$. We divide the value set into subsets:

  \begin{definition*}
      Let $F_{a,b}(x) = x^{\frac{q+1}{2}} + a x^{\frac{q+1}{d}} + b x$ be a polynomial defined over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ where $d \mid q-1$. We define the sets $A_l = \left\{F_{a,b}(\alpha^{d k+i}) \mid k=0,...,\frac{q-1}{d}\right\}$ for $i=0,...,d-1$, where $\alpha$ is a primitive root of $\mathbb{F}_{q}$.
    \end{definition*}

    For these subsets we have proved the following lemmas

    \begin{lemma}\label{conjuntos_disjuntos}
      Let $F_{a,b}(x)$ be defined over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ and $A_l$ be defined as above. For two sets $A_l$ and $A_k$ we must have that either $A_l \cap A_k = \emptyset$ or $A_l = A_k$.
    \end{lemma}

    \begin{lemma}\label{tamanos_conjuntos}
      Let $F_{a,b}(x)$ be defined over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ and $A_l$ be defined as above. We have that $\left\vert A_l \right\vert = \frac{q-1}{d}$ or $A_l = \left\{ 0 \right\}$
    \end{lemma}

    \begin{proposition}
      Let $F_{a,b}(x)$ be defined over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ and $A_l$ be defined as above. $F_{a,b}(x)$ is a permutation polynomial if and only if $A_l \cap A_k = \emptyset for 0 \leq l,k \leq d-1$
    \end{proposition}

    \textbf{Aim:}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Find necessary and sufficient conditions on the coefficients $a=\alpha^i$, $b=\alpha^j$ such that $A_l \cap A_k = \emptyset$
      \item Study our results on the family of polynomials of the form $F_{a,b}(x) = x^{\frac{q+1}{2}+m} + a x^{\frac{q+1}{d}+m} + b x^{m}$
    \end{itemize}
