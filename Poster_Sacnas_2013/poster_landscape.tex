   A polynomial $f(x)$ defined over a set $A$ is called a \textbf{permutation polynomial} if $f(x)$ acts as a permutation over the elements of $A$. This is, if $f: A \rightarrow A$ is 1-1 and onto. We are studying the coefficients $a$ and $b$ that make polynomials of the form $F_{a,b}(x)=x^{\frac{p+1}{2}} + ax^{\frac{p+5}{6}} + bx$ a permutation polynomial where $a,b \in \mathbb{F}_{q}^{\times}$. More specifically we study the family of polynomials: $F_{a,b}(x)=x^{\frac{p+1}{2}} + ax^{\frac{p+5}{6}} + bx$. Our approach in studying $F(x)$ is to use the division algorithm to consider $x=\alpha^{n}$ where $n=6k+r, r=0,...,5$. If $F_{a,b}(x)$ is a permutation, this partitions $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{\times}$ into 6 classes: $F_{a,b}(\alpha^{6k+r})$ for $r=0,...,5$.

   We formulated tracking as path search in a large graph, and solve it
   efficiently with a modificiation of Dijkstra's algorithm.  

   The method is based on \cite{awf:tracking}. Our main contributions are
   \begin{enumerate}\compresslist
   \item Efficient incorporation of a background appearance model
   \item Formulation as a shortest path problem
   \item (Correct) handling of occlusions
   \item High-Efficiency implementation with up to 150 fps for a high
   resolution video
   \end{enumerate}

\indent{}Speed is achieved by preprocessing the video with an adaptive filter
bank as in~\cite{awf:tracking}. Preprocessing was sped up significantly, but is
still slower than realtime.

This encodes the video into 16 byte per pixel feature vectors. We implemented
an efficient search for similar patches using the SIMD hardware of modern
processors, and only evaluate the cost on these candidate patches. (Typically
200 patches per frame). Candidate search and reasoning are highly efficient
resulting in an interactive system.

Note that the preprocessing is not specific to the interestpoints tracked
later. A single preprocessed video can therefore be used in many annotation
sessions.

    Between one and three user clicks were needed to achieve accurate tracking for
      the head sequence. Note the correct handling of the occluded ear, which
      required only a single click. 

      The eye of the running giraffe required eight user interactions, of which three
      marked occlusions.

  A polynomial $f(x)$ defined over a set $A$ is called a \textbf{permutation polynomial} if $f(x)$ acts as a permutation over the elements of $A$. This is, if $f: A \rightarrow A$ is 1-1 and onto.
\end{definition}

We study permutation polynomials defined over finite fields $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. This is, polynomials that permute the elements of $\mathbb{F}_{q}$

\begin{definition}
  A \textbf{finite field} $\mathbb{F}_{q}$, $q=p^{r}$, $p$ prime is a field with $q$ elements.
